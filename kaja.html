	<centre><h1>KAKINADA KAJA</h1><br>
        <p>
            The batter is made using wheat flour, mawa, and oil. The pastry is then deep-fried till crisp before being drenched in Paga sugar syrup, which seeps into the crust. In Kakinada, a coastal town in Andhra Pradesh, Khaja is served dry on the outside and soaked in sugar syrup on the inside.
            Kotaiah Kaja used to be one of the iconic sweets of Kakinada. Now, it is one of the worst sweets you can buy in this store. Now, there are 3 Kotaiah Kaja stores in Kakinada and each one claims that they are the original recipe holders and authentic.
In my last visit to Kakinada, I purchased 2.5 kg Kajas to take back to Australia in multiple 250g boxes to give as gifts. The store promised that they are fresh and made only few hours before I purchase time.

After taking them home in Kakinada, many of our family members wanted to try them so we opened one box for tasting. Believe it or not, they are hard, no juice inside, we could cut them with knife into half. Tried several of them. All were like that. Took them back to the store and showed them. They said that the batch could be bad.

We went to other stores and tried. To our surprise, there is no juice/ syrup inside the Kajas. Very disappointed to hear the same story "this batch is not that good".

Bhanugudi junction store admitted that they are trying to reproduce original famous Kaja but they are not able to for the last couple of years. Chefs of the store are working hard to improve the quality.

Kotaiah Kaja store in Main Road is the worst and they also gave hard time to refund money even for the boxes that were not opened.

My suggestion: Stay away from these Kotaiah Kaja or taste few before you buy.

By the way, there are two qualities they sell: One made with pure Ghee and the other one with something. We purchased premium quality expensive ones but no luck.
