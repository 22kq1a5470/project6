	<centre><h1>PUTHAREKULU</h1><br>
        <p>
            Pootharekulu is described as sweet coated sheets because of their name and is consumed during festivals and auspicious occasions to relish with the family and neighbors. These sweet paper sheets or Pootharekulu are made from a rice batter named Jaya biyyam, which is mixed with sugar and ghee.
            Why are Indians, whether in North India or down South, obsessed with desserts? Well, no matter which part of India you go to, you will find a dessert unique to the destination.
To honour the natural love that we harbour for desserts, we thought of sharing a few fun and interesting facts about Pootharekulu or Poothareku, a popular sweet from Atreyapuram in Andhra Pradesh. As the name suggests, Atreyapuram has been named after Maharishi Atri, one of the ancient seers of India. Pootharekulu is a word derived from two words ‘Pootha’ meaning coating and ‘Rekulu’ meaning sheet. It is a paper-thin dessert made from rice start/gram flour, jaggery/sugar and clarified butter.

The melt-in-mouth Pootharekulu is originally made from rice or gram flour, and it is coated by sugar/jaggery and ghee. The people living in Atreyapuram are skilled in making this sweet.
Making Pootharekulu requires deftness of hands. Unfortunately, preparing it does not guarantee enough income, and it has not been able to spread beyond the geographical boundaries of its place of origin. Hence, it is a dying art nowadays.
Every year, a large number of humble dwellers in Atreyapuram prepare hundreds of Pootharekulu to be sent for sale in Indian towns and cities as well as abroad. Another unique confectionery item made in this province is Maamidi Thandra or mango jelly.
This mouth-watering treat noted for its crispiness is quite addictive by nature. The fact that people do not mind spending money on it proves how much loved it is in Andhra Pradesh.
