            Palkova, also known as Theratipal or Palgova, is a traditional South Indian sweet made from reducing milk and sugar to a thick, fudge-like consistency. It is a popular sweet dish in Tamil Nadu and is often prepared during festivals and special occasions.

To make palkova, milk is boiled and simmered until it reduces significantly, leading to a thick texture. Sugar is then added to the reduced milk and cooked further until it reaches a solid consistency. Cardamom powder or saffron may be added for flavoring. The end result is a rich, creamy sweet that has a slightly grainy texture and a caramelized taste.

Palkova is typically served as a dessert or snack and is enjoyed by people of all ages. It has a rich and indulgent flavor that makes it a favorite among those with a sweet tooth.
Srivilliputhur Palkova, a milk sweet made in Srivilliputhur, Tamilnadu is also called milk Peda or milk halwa.

But, the unique taste of Srivilliputhur Palkova lies in the fat-rich milk of cows nurtured under the foothills of the western ghats mountain range of Srivilliputhur. the abundance of healthy cows in this place has been continuing for centuries and it is commendably mentioned in the poetry of ancient Tamil poet Aandal. Srivilliputhur Palkova being prepared by the fire of Tamarind tree ( a heritage of Tamilnadu ) woods, results in turning it into a light brownish color that makes it distinct from the Palkovas made in other parts of the state.
